          The base class for all NPCs. This class extends the <code className="bg-white/20 px-2 py-1 rounded">BaseCharacter</code> class. Custom NPC classes are meant to extend this class.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-6">Class Fields</h3>
        <div className="space-y-4">
          <div>
            <code className="bg-white/20 px-2 py-1 rounded">bool bNPCEnabled</code>
            <p className="mt-2">A flag to control whether the NPC should execute autonomously, i.e., generate and perform their own tasks. This is meant to be an easy on-off switch. Note that, currently, this flag only controls whether NPCs will generate/perform tasks, but NPCs will still initiate and respond to conversations regardless of this flag.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <code className="bg-white/20 px-2 py-1 rounded">bool bLogTasks</code>
            <p className="mt-2">A flag to control whether to log the tasks that the NPC is generating for itself.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <code className="bg-white/20 px-2 py-1 rounded">FString Background</code>
            <p className="mt-2">The background description for the NPC, which might include things like their origin, personality, motivation, quirks, etc. The background is the primary component that will be used to generate an NPC's tasks and thus their overall behavior. This field will eventually be updated dynamically as the NPC interacts with the world but is currently still static.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <code className="bg-white/20 px-2 py-1 rounded">FString ShortTermGoal</code>
            <p className="mt-2">The NPC's short-term goal that will influence the general direction of their short-term tasks. This field will eventually be updated dynamically as the NPC interacts with the world but is currently still static.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <code className="bg-white/20 px-2 py-1 rounded">FString SelfAssessment</code>
            <p className="mt-2">The NPC's current self-assessment about their overall situation (such as their life, a particular goal, a relationship, a combination of them, etc.) which will also influence their overall behavior. This field will eventually be updated dynamically as the NPC interacts with the world but is currently still static.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <code className="bg-white/20 px-2 py-1 rounded">TMap{'<'}FName, FString{'>'} Relationships</code>
            <p className="mt-2">A map for the relationships that an NPC has with other characters at the start of gameplay. The keys are the full name of a character (e.g., Alice Smith) and the corresponding value being the full text description about the NPC's relationship with that character, which might include the nature of the relationship, the NPC's attitude toward that character, any relevant history, any outstanding commitments, etc. Note that this map is just meant to pre-populate an NPC's relationships for the beginning of play â€“ the NPC's relationships will be actively tracked by the NPC's controller and dynamically updated throughout play.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <code className="bg-white/20 px-2 py-1 rounded">TArray{'<'}AWorldActor*{'>'} KnownActorsAndLocations</code>
            <p className="mt-2">A list of <code className="bg-white/20 px-2 py-1 rounded">WorldActor</code> references intended to represent the objects and locations that an NPC should be aware of at the start of play. This field is currently only intended to be prepopulated with locations, e.g., homes, stores, workplaces, etc. <code className="bg-white/20 px-2 py-1 rounded">WorldActor</code> references added to this list can include any number of <code className="bg-white/20 px-2 py-1 rounded">EnvironmentComponent</code> instances, and the plugin will handle parsing so the NPC is aware of all the different physical locations.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <code className="bg-white/20 px-2 py-1 rounded">TArray{'<'}FString{'>'} ActionLibrary</code>
            <p className="mt-2">A list of the names of the actions that the NPC has access to and should use to complete a particular task. The specific names used for each action here is not of much importance to the plugin and is mainly provided as a way to specify an NPC's allowed actions from the editor. This field can be ignored if an NPC's action library is specified directly via code in the corresponding controller class.</p>

            <code className="bg-white/20 px-2 py-1 rounded">virtual void PauseCurrentAction()</code>
            <p className="mt-2">This function is called to pause an NPC's current in-game action and is primarily used to help NPCs transition between action sequences and conversations. When an NPC enters a conversation, their current action will be paused until the conversation finishes, at which point the paused action will be resumed. This function can be overridden to handle any processing that should happen when the NPC action is paused. The base implementation of this function simply stops any montage that is currently playing.</p>
